The stock market index has become one of the most common leading indicators used as a reference for economic conditions, both from the scale of the company to the scale of the national economy. In addition, the value of the stock market index is also often used by investment companies and individual investors as a reference in making investment decisions. Therefore, the ability to predict the movement of the stock market index value is a critical requirement. Here, data science can be applied through various methods and machine algorithms learning to analyze and predict the stock price of a company.
